# **Project Overview**
This project provides an interactive visualization of global events data, including earthquakes, and other significant occurrences such as natural disasters, weather patterns, and more. The data is sourced from various public APIs, and the visualizations are created using Tableau. The interactive maps and time-series animations help users explore event distributions, intensities, and trends over time.

## **Features**
- **Interactive World Map**: Displays event locations using markers that vary in size and color to represent event intensity.
- **Time Animation**: Explore how events change over time with animated views.
- **Filtering**: Filter events based on categories, magnitudes, or other relevant factors.
- **Color-Coding**: Events are color-coded based on severity, type, or other attributes for easy distinction.

## **Data Sources** 
The project uses data from various sources, such as:

- **USGS Earthquake Data**: Earthquake data sourced from the US Geological Survey (USGS).
- **Other APIs**: Future extensions will include other event data like hurricanes, volcanic activity, etc.
- **Custom Datasets**: Manually added datasets for non-seismic events.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive data visualizations and animations.
- **GeoJSON**: Data format used for importing event data.
- **GitHub**: For version control and hosting the repository.

## **Contributing**

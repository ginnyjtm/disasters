Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Storm - Unspecified / Other	Ontario, Quebec	11/15/2020 12:00:00 AM	On November 15th, a strong frontal system passed through Ontario and Quebec. The system brought an array of hazardous weather conditions: An EF1 tornado touched down near Georgetown; there were four confirmed downbursts events (Dunnville, New Dundee, Ingersoll, Port Burwell) with wind speeds ranging from 115-135 km/hr; strong winds across much of northeastern and southern Ontario (Port Colborne, for example, recorded maximum wind speeds of 132 km/hr with 10 consecutive hours of winds over 80 km/hr); and a significant seiche in Lake Erie (4 m sea level difference between Toledo, Ohio, and Buffalo, New York). As a result, this system generated widespread damage across Ontario and into Quebec - southwestern Ontario was the most impacted. By the early evening of November 15th, over 1 million individuals were without power in Ontario, Quebec, and the United States. Hydro One reported over 542,000 customers that were affected and over 500 downed hydro poles; power was still not fully restored to all customers by November 19th. Power outages were also reported in Quebec. This event is estimated to have cost $87 million (2020 CAD) in insured losses.	0	0	0			11/16/2020 12:00:00 AM						87000000.0000				
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Southern Ontairo and southern Quebec	1/10/2020 12:00:00 AM	On January 10th, a low pressure system moved through southern Ontario and Quebec which began with temperature highs of 10-12C and rain, before changing to freezing rain and snow by January 12th in some locations.

Incident	Conflict	Terrorist	Shootings	Ottawa ON	10/22/2014 12:00:00 AM	Ottawa ON, Oct 22, 2014. At approximately 09:52 EDT, an armed gunman  pulled up in their vehicle to the Ottawa National War Memorial where three Canadian Armed Forces members were posted on Ceremonial Guard sentry duty. The assailant shot at Cpl. Nathan Cirillo striking him twice in the back and fatally wounding him. The assailant then fired at the other sentries as they fled towards the Parliament buildings; but neither of the other sentries were struck or injured. Pulling up to Parliament Hill, the assailant ran from their car and carjacked an idling Parliamentary vehicle on the hill. Members of the RCMP began pursuit as he pulled the vehicle up and ran into the front doors of Parliament. Upon entering, the assailant engaged in a struggle with House of Commons Security Guard Samearn Son, who was shot in the foot in the ensuing struggle. The assailant fled further into the Parliament buildings and was fatally shot by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. In the ensuing search for additional shooters, many federal government buildings and offices were placed in lockdown. Public institutions such as the University of Ottawa and nearby schools were also placed in lockdown. There were false reports that a third shooting had taken place at the Rideau Centre Mall, fueled by high cellular phone and social media usage that also strained cell towers and communications infrastructure. Government employees were asked to restrict their Blackberry usage for emergencies only until the crisis was over to reduce burden on the system. The following day, Prime Minister Stephen Harper classified the attack as terrorism.	2	0	0	0.0000	0.0	10/22/2014 12:00:00 AM

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Southern Ontario	12/21/2013 12:00:00 AM	Southern Ontario, ON, December 21, 2013 to January 1, 2014. A severe storm brought freezing rain and damaging ice accumulation across a large area of southern Ontario. According to Environment Canada, the epicentre of the freezing rain was in southern Ontario along the north shore of Lake Ontario, including the Greater Toronto Area, where ice accumulation reached up to 30 mm. The impact of the ice storm on these municipalities and conservation authorities was further exacerbated by freezing temperatures. The ice storm had serious impacts. In its aftermath, as many as 830,000 hydro customers (2,490,000 individuals) across Southern Ontario were without power for several days. Downed trees, broken branches, and downed wires resulting from ice accumulation posed serious public health and safety risks, as well as transportation network problems. Due to widespread power outages and freezing temperatures, municipalities activated emergency plans to open warming centres and canvassed homes of vulnerable residents to ensure their safety. Power was restored to most residences and businesses by January 1, 2014.
Response and recovery activities began at the time of the event. The ice storm significantly impacted some of Canada’s largest and most densely populated urban municipalities. Municipalities, provincial ministries and non-governmental organizations such as the Red Cross all acted to respond to the ice storm. Ontario determined that the impacts of the storm were severe enough to warrant implementation of an Ice Storm Assistance Program to help municipalities and conservation authorities with emergency response and recovery costs. Two deaths were attributed to the storm due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improperly ventilated generators and heaters.

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Storms and Severe Thunderstorms	Hamilton and Toronto ON	7/26/2009 12:00:00 AM	Hamilton and Toronto ON, July 26, 2009. A storm cell stalled over the western end of Lake Ontario. Hamilton was hard hit. Waves of thunderstorms pounded the city, leaving citizens with flooded basements and motorists stuck in traffic caused by road closures. The midday downpour turned Red Hill Creek into an angry brown torrent that forced the closure of nearby roads and highways. Water gushed into 7000 basements and power was shut off to thousands of customers. While the Hamilton Airport observed only 28 mm of rain, radar estimates confirmed rainfall amounts in an unofficial gauge totaling 110 mm in two hours - worse than a 100-year storm and one of the most intense short-duration rainfalls on record in Canada. Conditions were made worse because the ground was super-saturated from storms two days earlier. In Toronto, parts of Lakeshore Boulevard near the Exhibition grounds were submerged. To the north, a pair of giant sinkholes swallowed part of Finch Avenue West - big enough to hold a fleet of cars and deep enough to cover a four-storey building.	0	0	0	173312000.0000	9089790.2	7/26/2009 12:00:00 AM						173312000.0000		0	0.0

Incident	Technology	Transportation accident	Rail	Key River, Ontario	9/23/1999 12:00:00 AM	At 1:11pm (local) on September 23rd, 26 freight cars derailed near Key River, ON, and adjacent to Little Key River. Of the several cars that derailed, one containing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and another containing anhydrous ammonia ruptured, leaked, and ignited. Only a few minutes later (1:48pm), another tank car loaded with LPG exploded. In total, 127,000 pounds of LPG and 158,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were released - most of which burned. A police office, 2 firefighters and a woodcutter were exposed to ammonia vapours and suffered minor injuries. Although no evacuation of nearby communities was needed, 3 local woodcutters and 2 hunters were evacuated from the area. Within 2 days, containment dams were installed up- and downstream of the derailment site. After 36 hours of rain, the containment dams breached on September 30th, and un-ionized ammonia was leaked into the river. High levels of contaminants persisted for 12 hours, and dead minnows were observed on October 2nd.	0	4	5			9/23/1999 12:00:00 AM										
Incident	Technology	Transportation accident	Vehicle	Windsor ON	9/3/1999 12:00:00 AM	Windsor ON, September 3, 1999.  Dense fog and high speed are blamed for a massive car pileup/accident on Hwy. 401 near Windsor. At least 40 vehicles collided, including transport trucks, vans and cars, resulting in seven deaths and 33 injuries.  The intensity of the fire, which caused the road's asphalt to melt, and the fire damage, which destroyed many of the vehicles, made it impossible to fully understand how the collisions occurred.  At least five separate accidents occurred, blocking both sides of the highway.	7	33	0			9/3/1999 12:00:00 AM	0.0000	0.0000						0	0.0

Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Southern Ontario	4/5/1979 12:00:00 AM	On the evening of April 5th, a winter storm moved into Ontario. As the storm progressed overnight, the weather changed from rain to snow. By the 6th, the wind was blowing at roughly 50-65 km/hr with gusts of up to 119 km/hr. Blowing snow caused severe road conditions. There were two serious highway accidents along Highway 400 alone which involved 60 cars near Bradford. The strong winds also overturned trucks. High waves and rafting ice caused severe marine conditions. A 2 meter seiche with rafting ice was reported along the eastern shoreline of Lake Erie which temporarily reduced the flow of Niagara Falls to only 0.5%. At least two freighters (The "Labradoc" and the "Canadian Mariner") required joint Canadian-US Coast Guard rescues. There was widespread damage across southern and central Ontario including glass panes being blown out of office buildings in downtown Toronto, damaged roofs, downed trees, and widespread power outages. The storm also produced a tornado at 9:30pm (local) 5km north of Leamington.	9	0	0			4/6/1979 12:00:00 AM										
Disaster	Natural	Meteorological - Hydrological	Winter Storm	Southern Ontario  	4/4/1979 12:00:00 AM	Southern Ontario was affected by 3 consecutive storms between April 4th and April 8th.

On April 5th, an intense low pressure system moved into Ontario from the Northwest Territories and tracked over the northern Great Lakes. This system produced a tornado near Leamington on the 5th, created 110 km/hr winds throughout southern Ontario including 128 km/hr winds recorded in Trenton, and 25cm of snow in the eastern Lake Superior region. As a result of this second storm, there were widespread power outages, vehicle accidents including a 60 car pile-up on Highway 400 north of Toronto as well as extensive property damage. Effects were not only limited to land. A 2m seiche as well as 5 m waves were reported on Lake Erie which caused a lake freighter to list and its crew of 20 to be evacuated. Ice jams also cause the flow over Niagara Falls to be reduced by 95%. On the 8th, a third storm moved in from the U.S. Midwest. This system brought freezing rain (e.g. 13 mm reported in London) and heavy snow (e.g.43.9 cm of snow in Hamilton).

Incident	Technology	Explosion	Non-Residential	Timmins, Ontario	2/10/1928 12:00:00 AM	On the morning of February 10th, a fire broke out underground at Hollinger mine - the largest gold mine in North America at the time. Miners working the No. 11 shaft realized that something was wrong when miners were ringing for help at the cage stations while others were escaping to the surface along the emergency ladders. The fire and resultant smoke at the 550 ft level was being carried through the mine workings which was 100s of kilometers long. Within an hour, rumours and news of the disaster circulated in the community, and worried family and friends began to gather at the mine. At the time, there were no mine rescue teams in Ontario; the closest being in Pennsylvania. However, the Toronto Fire Department shipped firefighting equipment on a special train to Timmins - all train traffic was halted in order to expedite the efforts. By the afternoon, roughly 50 miners were still unaccounted for. The next day, a small group of miners were found using extraordinary measures to stay alive. Sadly, 39 miners did not survive. After an inquiry, it was found that the fire started spontaneously in an abandoned stope as a result of gross negligence. After this disaster, mine safety measures were developed including the formation of mine rescue teams in Ontario.	39	0	0			2/10/1928 12:00:00 AM

Disaster	Natural	Biological	Epidemic	Windsor, Ontario	2/2/1924 12:00:00 AM	On February 2nd, a citizen of Windsor (case 1) became seriously ill with a virulent form of hemorrhagic smallpox. The doctors did not initially consider smallpox until other individuals in close contact with the initial patient became sick. Case 1 died of smallpox on February 11th. Cases 2, 3, and 4 did not present with symptoms until February 20th and 24th. However, by the time smallpox was recognized, it had already spread in Windsor and neighbouring communities including Detroit. On the evening of February 23rd, the Local Board of Health made the decision to quarantine those who were sick and their families, and to vaccinate the entire population of the city (70,000). The majority of physicians in the entire region were mobilized within 30 minutes, and vaccines were being given by the next morning. Within 6 days, 95% of the population was successfully vaccinated. Out of 67 individuals who became ill with smallpox, 32 died (a fatality rate of 48%). Not a single person who was vaccinated died of smallpox.	32	35	0			3/2/1924 12:00:00 AM										
Disaster	Natural	Biological	Epidemic	Cochrane, Ontario	3/19/1923 12:00:00 AM	In the early 1920s, the primary water supply for the community of Cochrane, ON, was natural springs. As the community grew, the springs were no longer able to meet the community requirements (such as fire suppression), therefore pumps were also connected to Spring Lake. The need for an improved water supply was identified in the summer of 1921, but no improvements were made. Typically, Spring Lake would sit higher than other waterways; however, water was needed from the lake during the fall and winter of 1922-1923. With this, the water level was lowered to the point that it was below the level of surrounding waterways which were contaminated with sewage. On March 11, 1923, the Provincial Sanitary Engineer determined that it was imperative to install a chlorination device, and oversaw its installation on March 15th. However, the contamination of the water supply had already infected residents and the first cases of typhoid were recorded within days. By April 3rd, there were 600 cases and 12 deaths which quickly grew to 823 cases and 59 deaths.	59	823	0			5/31/1923 12:00:00 AM

Disaster	Natural	Biological	Epidemic	Ottawa, Ontario	6/1/1912 12:00:00 AM	In June of 1912, a typhoid epidemic began in Ottawa. Following a serious epidemic in the previous year, recommendations were made to improve the water supply including adding more hypochlorite of lime as a temporary measure, the construction of a new intake pipe as well as the construction of a proper filtration plant. The construction of a new intake pipe was finished and in use by April 13th, 1912. Two weeks later, water tests continued to show water contamination because the old intake pipe (which was in poor condition) was still being used. Relatively little action had taken place and in June, 10 cases of typhoid were reported. A month later, there were over 1,000 cases. The number of infections diminished by the end of September. In total, 1,378 individuals had been infected and 91 died as a result.	91	1378	0			9/30/1912 12:00:00 AM
